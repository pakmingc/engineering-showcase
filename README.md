# Engineering Showcase

This repository demonstrates my engineering approach through architecture documentation, decision logs, and anonymized case studies. No production code is included - this is purely documentation to support technical discussions during interviews.

## What's Inside

| Document | Description |
|----------|-------------|
| [Architecture Diagrams](docs/architecture.md) | System design patterns I've implemented |
| [Decision Log](docs/decision-log.md) | Technical decisions with context and trade-offs |
| [Engineering Practices](docs/engineering-practices.md) | My approach to testing, CI/CD, and code quality |
| [Case Studies](docs/case-studies.md) | Anonymized examples of problems I've solved |
| [Pseudocode Examples](examples/pseudocode.md) | Code patterns demonstrating my style |

## Why This Exists

Most of my work is in private repositories. This showcase allows me to:

1. **Demonstrate architectural thinking** without exposing proprietary code
2. **Document decisions** that show engineering maturity
3. **Provide talking points** for technical interviews
4. **Show patterns** I use across different projects

## How to Use This

**For Recruiters:** Browse the case studies and decision log to understand the scope and complexity of my work.

**For Technical Interviews:** Use these documents as starting points for deeper discussions. I'm happy to elaborate on any topic in a screen-share.

## Note on Anonymization

All examples are anonymized:
- Client names replaced with "Client A", "Project X", etc.
- URLs use `example.com` placeholders
- Metrics are approximate or omitted
- No proprietary algorithms or business logic included
